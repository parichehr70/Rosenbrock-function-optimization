# Rosenbrock-function-optimization
First,the Rosenbrock function is defined with the values a = 1 and b = 100. This function takes two inputs x1 and x2. The gradient of the Rosenbrock function is calculated and stored in the variable G. Then the root values of the function gradient, which are the critical points of the function, are obtained and the value is double
They are stored in two variables X1 and X2. Finally, the Hessian matrix of the function is obtained.
Then the number of critical points of the loop is repeated and the eigenvalue for all these points is calculated and stored in variable D. Finally, the maximum step size value is calculated and the function value is stored at critical points in the variable y.
According to the output, this function has only one critical point in (1,1), which is equal to zero. Therefore, the global minimum value of this function is zero.The maximum step size and the specific value are as follows: 
D =
1.0e+03 *
0.0004
1.0016
alpha_max =
0.0020
